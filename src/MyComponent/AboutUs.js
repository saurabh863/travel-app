            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>The Trippy road trip planner automatically calculates the optimal itinerary including stops recommended by Trippy members, favorite restaurants and hotels, local attractions and things to do based on what people who live in the area have suggested, and more.

</p>

<h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Once you have a quick trip planned, you can customize every detail, adding or removing stops, or changing what time you leave in the morning or how long you stay at each stop. Then you can save your custom trip and share it with friends and family.

</p>

<h1>Our  Vision</h1>
            <p>Let us know if you have requests for more features you'd like to see in the trip planner!
